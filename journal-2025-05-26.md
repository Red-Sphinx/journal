## Journal Entry — May 26, 2025

### What I Did the 23rd and the 26th(today)
- I Finished setting up my GitHub repository using WSL on Windows on the 23rd.
- I also Learned Git basics: init, add, commit, push but need to practice more.
- I also created a `README.md` and `journal.txt` and pushed to GitHub and today the 26th I renamed from my wsl on Windows.
- Made repo public: https://github.com/Red-Sphinx/journal on the 23rd

### Questions for ChatGPT
1. How do I structure this journal better for long-term tracking of my CGPT learning?
By structuring better for long-term tracking I assume you mean using my Learning Journals in GitHub rather than Obsidian. In the past learining journals piles up on my computer (although online but expire after some time and then it is removed) and it takes diskspace as well as becoming an unsorted mess after awhile. Here in GitHub I can just keep updating it and the previous entries will always exist if I need to reflect or track the date of some past activity. This makes jounaling much more organized than keeping it on my pc. The aim of the learning journal is to get feedback from chatGPT, acknowledge learned material as a method of reflection, and to track progress. I will also need to have a section or seperate .md files where I can record the weekly, monthly, and yearly goals. 

2. Can GitHub be used for coding + learning logs combined? Should I make subfolders?
I'm still learning as I practice using the features of Github. I first took it up on the 23rd to use it myself and it can definitely be used for coding and learning logs combined. My aim today is to start a c++ project that I can expand and grow inorder to practice my programming skills as well as my tools at hand. Subfolders could be created as needed. I have no idea at this stage what I will need, but subfolders can be useful.

3. What if I want to write longer markdown journal posts? Should I rename `.txt` to `.md`?
I just renamed this journal from journal.txt to journal-2025-05-26.md. The markdown files has more feathures than the plain text capabilities of the .txt files. 

4. How do I pull updates if I edit files directly on GitHub?
Great question - at this stage all I know is the gh pr requests-command if I'm not mistaken and it is something that I will look into later today.

5. What’s the next best Git command I should learn (e.g. branches, pull, diff, log)?
I think pull because it is the next logically useful thing known to me and the others I'm not sure of and sounds like things that I will deal with when there is more content pushed and activity after some time.

6. Can I use GitHub for code + art portfolio at the same time?
That will be great if i can add art in my repositories such as Industrial Design and graphic design of game characters used if I want to code a game.

### Notes to Self
- Remember `git status` is useful to see file changes.
git or gh? I'll use wsl. 
- I skipped a few days because Git took longer to learn — but it’s worth it!
This is to be used daily
- C++ learning is next — start from the notes ChatGPT prepared.
Today I will start my c++ repo.
