## Journal Entry — May 24, 2025

### What I Did
- Finished setting up my GitHub repository using WSL on Windows.
- Learned Git basics: init, add, commit, push.
- Created `README.md` and `journal.txt` and pushed to GitHub.
- Made repo public: https://github.com/Red-Sphinx/journal

### Questions for ChatGPT
1. How do I structure this journal better for long-term tracking of my CGPT learning?
2. Can GitHub be used for coding + learning logs combined? Should I make subfolders?
3. What if I want to write longer markdown journal posts? Should I rename `.txt` to `.md`?
4. How do I pull updates if I edit files directly on GitHub?
5. What’s the next best Git command I should learn (e.g. branches, pull, diff, log)?
6. Can I use GitHub for code + art portfolio at the same time?

### Notes to Self
- Remember `git status` is useful to see file changes.
- I skipped a few days because Git took longer to learn — but it’s worth it!
- C++ learning is next — start from the notes ChatGPT prepared.
